Lyrixon - web app built with React, searching for music and lyrics at the same time :musical_note:

![lyrixon-screen](screens/lyrixon-screen.png)

Web application using Spotify and Apiseed's Lyrics APIs which enables user to find a song
and provides apropriate lyrics at once. I would like to develop my app, so in the nearest future I am going to give user the opportunity to log in with his Spotify account and to implement RWD solutions. 

### Used technologies:
- React
- CSS
- Fetch
